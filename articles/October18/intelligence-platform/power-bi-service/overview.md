#  Overview


[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

Power BI is helping organizations of every size transform their businesses with
data. Today, we are releasing new capabilities in Power BI to scale to the needs
of the largest enterprises with Power BI Premium and advanced enterprise
reporting capabilities. We are also introducing new End User Analytics features,
which dramatically lower the barrier for every user to explore and find insights
in their data using AI and natural user experiences.

-   **Analytics at any scale with Premium.** With Power BI Premium, there are no
    limits between you and achieving transformational results for your
    organization. Enjoy higher data size limits, better metrics and monitoring,
    and entirely new report formats, with pixel-perfect reports built using SQL
    Server Reporting Services Report Builder, integrated in the same Power BI
    environment for easy management. And for organizations with unique
    compliance needs for data locality, Power BI Premium Multi-Geo enables you
    to deploy capacity around the world in specific regions.

-   **Enterprise reporting.** With Power BI, you have a single tool that works
    for the full spectrum of your reporting needs. From small teams
    collaborating on data, to the largest enterprise reports distributed
    company-wide, Power BI is flexible while being familiar to all users. For
    the most demanding enterprise use cases, email subscriptions to multiple
    users, filtered views, and exporting to PDF ensure that no matter the
    audience, Power BI can deliver. Dashboard theming and other navigation
    enhancements to Power BI Apps allow you to tailor your end usersâ€™ experience
    to match your brand and processes. Additional governance and administrative
    reports and APIs allow you to control and monitor usage, anywhere in the
    organization.

-   **End user analytics.** Power BI enables everyone to find insights in their
    data. And now, it is even easier. User bookmarks let users save their most
    important findings and share them with others. New explore actions on
    visualizations, allow end users to quickly filter or segment data to find
    new insights without waiting for analysts to create new reports. With Power
    BI Home, users can get quick access to their most important content and
    create an at-a-glance view of their most important metrics. When users are
    away from Power BI, Smart Alerts proactively monitor their most important
    metrics and alert them of significant changes, so they can stay ahead of the
    curve.

-   **Power BI governance.** Today we are announcing the public preview of new governance capabilities integrated with Power BI. Get the most value from your
    existing assets and to make data sources easily discoverable and
    understandable by the users who manage data. Key features include auto
    tagging and detection of data assets in Power BI containing Personally
    Identifiable Information (PII) and the ability to promote and certify datasets across an organization.
